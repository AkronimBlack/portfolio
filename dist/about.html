                <h3 class="text-secondary">Who am I?</h3>
                <p class="indent">I am a self-taught programmer that has spent most of his life dabbling in code. At an age
                    of 26 I have decided to dig deeper in software development and have since spent almost all of my free
                    time writing code. From smaller procedural scripts to larger MVC based web pages. How the scope of my
                    ambitions grew so did my skills and methods, from a beginner writing code in c++ through my first solo
                    hobby-project of making a landing page in php, html5 and css to my latest project where I use Laravel,
                    Vue.js and SASS to create a fully responsive Web app.</p>

                <p class="indent"> I vigorously seek out knowledge, new technologies and techniques to improve myself. What
                    I lack in experience I will more than make up with my ability and will to learn and improve. I wholeheartedly
                    belive that those that meet me and talk to me will see my potential and will not be dissappointed in
                    my work and effort.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="job job-1">
                <h3 class="text-secondary">Front end</h3>
                <p class="indent"> I have spent enough time around the Web to know that javascript is an inescapable part
                    of any page, hence I invested my time in learning it. After some time I migrated to Vue.js that has shocked
                    me with its ease of use and learning curve.
                </p>
                <p class="indent">I look forward to an oportunaty to learn both React and Angular as well.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="job job-2">
                <h3 class="text-secondary">Back end</h3>
                <p class="indent"> This is an area that I truly shine in. Since most of my focus has been on the server-side
                    development of any page it stands to reason that this is where I am most experienced. I am well versed
                    in both vanilla PHP and its framework Laravel and I am looking forward to an upcoming project in Symfony.
                </p>
                <p class="indent">In the future I plan on mastering both Java and Node.js as well, seeing how they are the
                    better option for mobile app development.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="job job-3">
                <h3 class="text-secondary">Styling</h3>
                <p class="indent"> In all honesty I am rather new to the world of styling. I have picked up SASS recently
                    once it became obvious what kind of an asset it can be. The more code-like syntax and the ease of use
                    blew me away and I look forward to using it more and more in the upcoming years.
